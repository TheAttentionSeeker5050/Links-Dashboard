# Links Dashboard

Link Dashboard with .NET” stands as a core entry in my portfolio—a practical solution for efficient bookmark management.

## Overview: 
I’ve developed this dashboard using MySQL, .NET MVC, Razor Pages, Docker Compose, jQuery, and session authentication.

## Key Features

*User Authentication:* Securely log in, register, and manage sessions for a personalized experience.
*Bookmark Operations:* Easily add, delete, and edit bookmarks based on your preferences.
*Category Management:* Efficiently organize bookmarks by editing existing category names.
